# For Sure
## Apartments
*Rangal has a visual example of this but I'm not commiting it to this repo*.
Just think american suburbia town-homes that are moderately clustered street-wise.

## Long White Hallway
Rangal: long white hallway that plays with the timer concept, how far out will you go knowing you have to walk all the way back?

## Fruiter Aero: Wii Pool
I saw an image of these big Wii consoles in a large body of water with aquatic fauna and stuff and I want to replicate that. Maybe it could be a platforming station?

## Office at Night

## City Skytop
Takes placae on rooftops and has sky bridges that link each building.

# Quick Fire Ideas
Japanese suburban town
Japanese alleyway / red-light district
Empty fast food resturant (including parking lot / back room)
